## Overview

My research focuses on **AI**, **Computer Vision**, **Virtual Reality** and **Human-AI Interaction** in Digital Film Production.
I am also interested in Cinematic Virtual Reality (VR Filmmaking, VR Storytelling), 
VFX in Filmmaking (Motion Capture, Digital Double, Digital Asset Management), 
and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) in Digital Art.
<br><br>
In 2024, I was selected into the Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by BAST, under the supervision of [**Prof. Wenwu Zhu**](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1306/4336.htm). 
In 2019, I obtained my **Ph.D.** in Computer Science and Technology, majoring in Digital Art and Design, 
from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, supervised by [**Prof. Weidong Geng**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/capggeng#0). 
<br><br>
I am looking for **students** and **RA**, who are self-motivated and highly interested in film production, with a background in computer science, digital media, or related major.
<br>Please contact me via email, with your CV and portfolio.
